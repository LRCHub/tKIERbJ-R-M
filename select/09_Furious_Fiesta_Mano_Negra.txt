Hey hey esto pare Furious
Go out Go out for the Furious Fiesta

I gonna do the mess around
Around this town cause I'm a trouble bound

I just can't stand it's too much DO DO
I just can't stand it's too much oh nonono

It' time for the big show
& I'm ready to blow the lights out & shout
& Shout shout shout
I want more more more
Everything is red & it's buzzin' in my head

Am I gonna loose
My brain again
I wanna do it again

More rock
More reggea
More punk
More boogie
More fun
More booze
